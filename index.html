        Pat's Salmon Cookies is the new cookie store that is sweeping the nation. 
        <br \><br \>

        Started in 2018 Pat's Salmon Cookies was founded by Pat Patterson in Seattle, Washington. His inspiration came from two of the Pacific Northwest's most identifiable features, salmon and coffee. While enjoying a cup of the PNW's best coffee offerings, Pat realized that nothing goes better with coffee, than cookies. 
        <br \><br \>
        Having just come the river, where he caught a salmon with his bare hands, and like a grizzly bear devoured the salmon raw, Pat also happened to have salmon on the brain. Thus, the masterpiece that is taking over the world. 
        <br \><br \>
        Pat's Salmon Cookies has expanded it's stores from several branches in the greater Seattle area, to all over the world. In addition to the PNW, Pat's Salmon Cookies has stores in Tokyo, Dubai, Paris, and Lima.
