### Reflections and Comments
* Class06 - Salmon Cookies Part I

I really learned a lot about objects and methods in this lab. It was really fun, and I'm super glad that I got to do it. I also feel like I really got to contribute to the growth of the rest of the class, which makes me happy <3

Hopefully going forward I can continue to feel comfortable with the projects, so that I can help make everyone else's lives easier
